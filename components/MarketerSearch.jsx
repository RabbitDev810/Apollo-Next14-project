                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a marketplace where influencers manipulate and exploit their followings, it&apos;s natural the common investor may find themselves with lackluster and underperforming portfolio results. Well, a platform is here to finally level the playing field. The Apollo token will be the hyper deflationary ecosystem currency that will grant access to various functionalities designed to allow our users to remain competitive through changing market conditions.<br/>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apollo&apos;s burn-for-access requirements will compliment the burn amplification tokenomics such that participation in the ecosystem begets more reflections. This also creates a compounding deflationary principle that is novel for the space. As it&apos;s name infers, Apollo goes where none have before.
